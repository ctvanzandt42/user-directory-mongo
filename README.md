A user directory, built entirely using packages downloaded on Node.js. This was a Week 5 Project at the Iron Yard, the first week of Back End Fundamentals.

The home page rendered is a directory of users. Click on either the user's name or their picture to pull up a business card of sorts of that user. 

The data.js file was provided. However, one will find one or two added users that don't quite match the others.
